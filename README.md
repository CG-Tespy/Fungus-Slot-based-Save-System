# Fungus-Slot-based-Save-System
A replacement for the built-in Fungus Save System that is closer to the standard save systems you see in games. The repo hosts mainly a project bundled with Fungus as a template to help understand the system.
<br/><br/>
This was made with Fungus 3.10.0 in Unity 2018. It should work well for Unity 2017 and later, with Fungus 3.10.0 and later.
